# Using this Schedule

## Reading Due Dates

You should complete the readings listed under a given class session before that class begins. Any in-class assignments we complete will assume you have fully prepared all required readings for that day.

## A Key to Alerts

{% include alert alert='These red alert boxes signal a change of our typical schedule, such as meeting in a location outside the classroom or altered office hours during the week.' %}

{% include alert warning='These orange alert boxes signal an assignment due date.' %}

{% include alert info='These information boxes signal an in-class lab that we will work on together. As the semester progresses I will add links to the lab assignments to these boxes. Your fieldbook reports are due within a week of a given lab session).' %}
