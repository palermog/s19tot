# Using this Schedule

## Reading Due Dates

You should complete the readings listed under a given class session before that class begins. Any [in-class assignments](http://s18tot.ryancordell.org/assignments/inclasswork/) we complete will assume you have fully prepared all required readings for that day.

## Course Reading Packet

Most of our readings this semester are freely available online. There are a few books you will need to purchase—see the [required texts](http://s18tot.ryancordell.org/policies/#required-texts)—a few you will need to download in [this password-protect, zipped course packet](https://www.dropbox.com/s/f1aqdvvhqlhphj4/ToTcoursepacket.zip?dl=0). I will share the password to expand this zip file in class on the first day of class. 

## A Key to Alerts

{% include alert alert='These red alert boxes signal a change of our typical schedule, such as meeting in a location outside the classroom or altered office hours during the week.' %}

{% include alert warning='These orange alert boxes signal an assignment due date.' %}

{% include alert info='These information boxes signal an in-class lab that we will work on together. As the semester progresses I will add links to the lab assignments to these boxes. Your fieldbook reports are due within a week of a lab session, or the final lab session for those which extend through multiple class sessions, as indicated by the presence of letters (e.g. 5a and 5b).' %}
